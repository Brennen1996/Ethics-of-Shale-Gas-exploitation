# Ethics-of-Shale-Gas-exploitation
This report examines the performed evaluations for the potential exploitation of shale gas and points out critical difficulties that should be kept in mind when deciding on giving a green light for the exploitation.

The ethical considerations that are present during decision making are central in this report, as it is part of the Ethics and Impacts of Global Interventions (EPA1133) course at TU Delft.
